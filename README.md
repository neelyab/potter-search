Potter Search

Live Link: https://potter-search.vercel.app/

This app uses the Potter API and allows the user to search for characters of Harry Potter by house and by name.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I am not yet familiar with PHP (I am ready and willing to learn it!) However, due to time constraints of this technical test, I used React and Javascript to complete the project. I chose to use React so that I could make a controlled search form and dynamically render search results.
